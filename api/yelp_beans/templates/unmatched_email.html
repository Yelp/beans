    <p>Hi there {{first_name}}!</p>
    <p>
      Sorry we couldn't find a match for you this week for {{meeting_title}}. :(
      This usually happens because there were an odd number of people that
      signed up for the week, or people signed up for a time slot you haven't
      signed up for. To maximize your chances of getting a match,

      >
        sign up for more time slots!</a
      >
      If you have any questions please reach out to rkwills@yelp.com
