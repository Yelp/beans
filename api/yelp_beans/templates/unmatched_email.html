            Sorry we couldn't find a match for you this week for {{meeting_title}}. :( This usually happens because there were an
            odd number of people that signed up for the week, or people signed up for a time slot you haven't signed up for. To 
            maximize your chances of getting a match, 
            <a href="https://{{project}}.appspot.com" style="color: #666666; text-decoration: underline;"> sign up for more time
            slots!</a> If you have any questions please reach out to rkwills@yelp.com
        </p>
