            Hi {{first_name}}!
        </p>
        <p>
            We would like to introduce you to Beans -- here to help you start meeting new people,
            share knowledge, and explore our diverse culture.  Beans will match you with a different
            co-worker every week for a 30 minute coffee meeting.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>How it works:</b> Once you select a meeting preference by clicking the button below,
            Beans will send you an email each Monday asking if you want to meet someone new that
            week.  If you select “Yes”, mid-week we will match you.  If don’t select “Yes”, no
            worries!  We won’t match you that week and will follow up the next week.  Before your
            meeting, you will receive details about that week's match. On the day of the meeting,
            look for your match based on the details you receive in the match email and strike up a
            conversation!
        </p>
